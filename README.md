### Robert-Jan Bruintjes

*PhD candidate with Jan van Gemert @ Computer Vision Lab, TU Delft.*

I work on supervised representation learning for Computer Vision. My main research is into integrating prior knowledge into Convolutional Neural Networks to benefit data efficiency. Topics of choice include implicit neural convolutional operators, in- and equivariant representations and data-efficiency of self-attention.
